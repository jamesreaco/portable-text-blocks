## Introduction

A collection of custom blocks to be used with Sanity's Portable Text editor.

To see a live preview of the blocks visit the [demo](https://portable-text-blocks.vercel.app/) site.

Each block has a custom preview component built with [Sanity UI](https://www.sanity.io/ui) that can be added to the Portable Text editor as well as a component to render the block on the frontend built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

If you find this project helpful don't forget to give it a watch and star to be notified when I add new blocks to the collection!
